    <h3 id="tool-bar"><a class="toclink" href="#tool-bar">Tool Bar</a></h3>
    <p>
      Under the menu there is the program's toolbar: by clicking on the icons,
      you can, in the following order:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>New</strong>: creates a new empty document;</li>
      <li><strong>Open</strong>: opens a saved project;</li>
      <li><strong>Save</strong>: saves the current project;</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Open Image or Video...</strong>: opens a file dialog to open an
        image or video file.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="status-bar">
      <a class="toclink" href="#status-bar">Status Bar</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Status Bar on the bottom of the main window contains important
      information about the current state of بـستا. It is normally in "Ready"
      state, but it becomes "Busy" as soon as بـستا receives a command. Once
      done, the status bar returns in "Ready" state. In the case of
      time-consuming filters, progress percentage is shown.
    </p>
    <h3 id="viewer-window">
      <a class="toclink" href="#viewer-window">Viewer Window</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      The <em>Viewer</em> is the window in the center of the screen. It shows
      the frame which we are currently working on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each chain in the workspace has its <em>Viewer</em>: when closing the
      <em>Viewer</em>, the chain will be deleted from history.
    </p>
    <p>
      The image inside the <em>Viewer</em> shows the effect of the filter
      currently selected in the history and of the previous ones. Thus, the
      review of the processing steps is very simple and easy to understand: you
      have just to click on the desired filter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible to drag different files into the <em>Viewer</em>. You can
      drag an image, a video or an .afp project file. It is also possible to
      drag multiple images (creating a Sequence Loader) or multiple videos
      (creating one chain for each video). Dragging a folder is also supported
      and is equal to dragging its contents. The new chains with the dragged
      files appear at the position that is currently selected in the
      <a href="#history-panel"><em>History</em></a
      >. If you want to place them at the end, just clear the selection by
      clicking on the empty space at the bottom of the <em>History</em>.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2 id="filters-panel">
      <a class="toclink" href="#filters-panel">Filters Panel</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Filters panel, located on the left side of the main window, contains
      all the filters you can apply to an image or video. They are divided in
      different categories, according with the type of action they perform. By
      double-clicking on a category, the complete list of filters will be
      opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      To select one of them and add it to the current chain in the history, just
      single-click the desired filter. The new filter will be immediately added
      after the last selected filter. On the other hand Loaders always create a
      new chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that all filters can be applied to images, sequences of images
      and videos. However, there are cases in which the output of a filter
      returns the input image unchanged. This occurs mainly when you apply to
      images filters that need more than one frame to work properly. The
      categories of filters are the following.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em
        >Note: depending on your version of بـستا some of the following groups
        may not be available. If you require the additional filters showed,
        please inquire about upgrading your version.</em

    </p>
    <h3 id="load-group">
      <a class="toclink" href="#load-group">Load group</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      This type of filters allows loading images, videos or sequences from
      files. They allow selecting the file by typing a path, using the system
      dialogs, or by dragging and dropping it from the desktop or any Explorer
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since revision 18800, new Loaders are created at the position that is
      currently selected in the <a href="#history-panel"><em>History</em></a
      >. If you want to place them at the end, just clear the selection by
      clicking on the empty space at the bottom of the <em>History</em>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="write-group">
      <a class="toclink" href="#write-group">Write group</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Writers allow saving the output of a filter by writing the result of
      processing (image or video) to one or more user defined files. Please note
      that, once saved, if you add any filter after the writer, it will work on
      the saved file. Therefore, we may say that a writer is a sort of loader
      for some aspects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Differently from all other filters, writers have to be updated manually.
      If some change is made on any filter in the same chain before the writer,
      the output will not be overwritten until the user pushes again the "Apply"
      button on the writer's toolbar. A writer can be useful in many ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        it allows exporting the results of processing by generating a file
        containing the processed data;
      </li>
      <li>
        it allows a non-sequential access to those videos that use particular
        codecs that prevent it, as described in the FAQ section;
      </li>
      <li>
        it allows making a sort of explicit buffering. Each frame is calculated
        in real-time and sometimes the amount of work may be too heavy for the
        CPU; in this case, the playing slows down. A writer may come handy in
        this situation because it saves results of previous filters, so they
        don't need to be re-calculated on the fly. Every new filter added to the
        chain, after the writer, will continue to be computed in real-time.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="select-frames-group">
      <a class="toclink" href="#select-frames-group">Select Frames group</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      When using this kind of filters, you can select one or more frames of
      interest from the input file. It is possible to use any media as input,
      but a selector will have no effect on a single image. Generally, they
      change the length of a video, but they don't modify its frames. If you
      choose, for example, frames from 10 to 20, in the resulting output media
      the frame number 0 will correspond to frame 10 of the input media. To
      avoid mistakes, you can configure selectors only when "Show Input" mode is
      selected, i.e. when you are displaying the input and not the output image.

      This kind of filter implements basic image processing functionality
      involving geometric transformations. Generally:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>they separately work on single frames;</li>
      <li>
        they can modify the image characteristics (size, number of channels,
        color depth);
      </li>
      <li>they don't modify the video length (number of frames).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="channels-group">

      channels.
    </p>
    <h3 id="adjust-group">
      <a class="toclink" href="#adjust-group">Adjust group</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      These filters are useful to tune the pixel intensity of a specific region
      of the image. In general:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>they separately work on single frames;</li>
      <li>
        they don't modify the image characteristics (size, number of channels,
        color depth);
      </li>
      <li>they don't modify the video length (number of frames).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Without going into details, we can say that all digital images are
      represented by a sequence of numbers between lower and upper limits. In
      the 8-bit format these limits are 0 and 255. For every pixel there is a
      numeric value of this type. For black and white images, the value 0
      corresponds to a black pixel, while the value 255 stands for white. Color
      images are slightly different because they are made of three channels
      (red, green, blue). Each channel can be represented as a black and white
      image that contains data about the intensity of the color, pixel by pixel.
      This decomposition is done in such a way that, putting together the three
      components again, we will get the original image. Filters of the "Adjust"
      category map separately input image values to other values of the output
      image, for every single pixel, following a certain table ("look-up
      table").

      These filters allow checking metadata of the image or verifying the hash
      code for tracing the originality of images. They don't process the image
      at all; they simply provide some useful information on the source file and
      also display the results in the report group.

      The filters of this category don't change the image characteristics;
      conversely its contents are processed to emphasize details and borders of
      the present objects. They can make appear the finest details, but if you
      go further, they can also raise noise level.

      These filters have the opposite effect of the sharpening ones. They are
      used to reduce the image noise level. This is usually noticed as
      granularity or pixels with the wrong color. You could need to use these
      filters, when you have a digital camera shot taken in a low light
      condition.

      This category contains various filters for image restoration and
      enhancement. They are used for solving very specific problems, such as
      motion blur or compression artifacts. They don't modify image
      characteristics or video length. Every single frame is elaborated
      separately.

    <p>
      Filters in this category perform different kind of stabilization. They
      provide results only for videos or sequences of more images. The
      stabilization filters may either keep a region of interest steady in the
      image or stabilize the overall scene.

      In this category we can find the most powerful and CPU-intensive filters.
      They work on sequences and videos and their output could be very different
      from the original file. In general the result of the processing is an
      image which "sums up" all details and information present in every single
      frame.

      These filters provide some utilities for better presenting the final
      result for the processing, for example putting side by side the original
      and the processed image or hide sensitive details like witnesses faces or
      license plates of vehicles unrelated to the case.

    </h2>
    <p>
      The Assistant panel provides a tool which is something between a scripting
      system and wizard, allowing the user to go through a series of
      standardized steps in order to follow a proper workflow. For example, an
      agency can implement in an Assistant script its SOPs (standard operating
      procedures) in order to standardize the users workflow for specific
      situations. بـستا includes several workflows to be used as a starting
      point for some common situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The different workflows can be customized or added to for adaptation to
      individual or organizational preferences and needs. The panel can be
      displayed or hidden using the View menu or keyboard shortcut
      <em>"Alt + A"</em>.

    <h2 id="tools-panel">
      <a class="toclink" href="#tools-panel">Tools Panel</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The tools panel contains all the tools that allow you to interact with the
      dislayed image or with the filters. Thus, they don't actually process the
      data. You can activate a specific tool clicking on the tool at the top of
      the panel. Below is a description of various tools. Every tool condition
      the behavior of mouse command on the viewer.
    </p>
    <h3 id="inspector"><a class="toclink" href="#inspector">Inspector</a></h3>
    <p>
      The Inspector tool allows us to know the value of an image pixel. When the
      mouse is moving around the <em>Viewer</em> window, the coordinates x and y
      in the tool will vary accordingly. So will the R, G, B values of the pixel
      indicated below the mouse pointer.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Inspector is active, you can move around the image by dragging it
      into the <em>Viewer</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inspector displays the following values related to the pixel where the
      mouse is currently over:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>x</strong>: top-0 based horizontal coordinate of the pixel;
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>y</strong>: left-0 based vertical coordinate of the pixel;
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>R</strong>: red channel pixel value (not valid for grays scale
        images);
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>G</strong>: green channel pixel value (not valid for gray scale
        images);
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>B</strong>: blue channel pixel value (not valid for gray scale
        images);
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Y</strong>: intensity value of the pixel (corresponding to the
        value of the pixel for gray scale image and the gray scale converted
        pixel value for color images).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In the <em>Details</em> box, the additional information on the currently
      displayed frame is shown.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Position</strong>: current frame position in a video (always 0
        for a single image);
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Width</strong>: horizontal resolution of the current image in
        pixels;
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Height</strong>: vertical resolution of the current image in
        pixels;
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Type</strong>: color (3 channels) or gray scale (1 channel).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="zoom"><a class="toclink" href="#zoom">Zoom</a></h3>
    <p>
      The Zoom tool allows to magnify or to scale down the image. When selected,
      if you move the mouse pointer over the <em>Viewer</em>, the pointer will
      become a magnifying glass and you will be able to zoom on the area of
      interest.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In the Zoom combo box some predefined zoom values may be selected.
      </li>
      <li>
        With the <em>+</em> and <em>-</em> buttons you can raise or lower the
        zoom factor.
      </li>
      <li>
        The button <em>100</em> applies a zoom factor so that every pixel of the
        screen corresponds to a pixel of the image (1:1 scale);
      </li>
      <li>
        The <em>Fit Window</em> checkbox resizes the image so that it will match
        the window's size.
      </li>
      <li>
        Below those controls you will find a little preview and a selection
        rectangle over it. In the <em>Viewer</em> is displayed the contents of
        the selection rectangle and vice versa. Just above the preview area
        there is a slider; the more it is on the right (high zoom values), the
        smaller the rectangle is. Dragging the selection rectangle in the
        preview navigator will automatically shift the image in the
        <em>Viewer</em>, so it will be possible to perform image drag &amp;
        drop.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Please note that, if the <em>Zoom</em> tool is selected and you left-click
      on the image in the <em>Viewer</em>, you will raise the zoom factor, while
      with the right button you will lower it. By selecting a rectangle on the
      <em>Viewer</em> you will zoom on that area.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em
        >Note: the zoom panel does not apply any interpolation to the displayed
        image, it applies a simple pixel replication or decimation, depending on
        the zoom factor.</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <em
        >Note: you can always zoom in and out the current image even if the zoom
        tool is not active. Simply go with the mouse over the viewer and use the
        mouse wheel.</em
      >
    </p>
    <h3 id="selector"><a class="toclink" href="#selector">Selector</a></h3>
    <p>
      The Selector tool allows selecting an area of the image. When selected, if
      you move the mouse pointer over the <em>Viewer</em>, the pointer will
      become a cross and you will be able to select an area of the image. Just
      keep pressed the left mouse button while moving the mouse, to draw the
      selection rectangle. Once done, the tool panel will show the selected
      coordinates.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        By clicking on <em>Select All</em>, the selection will be expanded and
        will cover the whole image.
      </li>
      <li>
        By clicking on <em>Deselect</em>, the selection will be disabled. Please
        note that, if you change your mind at any time, you can achieve the same
        result by clicking on a point of the image that is outside of the
        selection rectangle.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <em>Zoom</em> button will automatically apply the maximum possible
        magnification to the selected area.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Please note that, once selected, it is possible to move the selection
      rectangle around: just place the mouse pointer on the center of it, and
      then drag it as you like. If you want to modify the rectangle's size, just
      place the mouse on its corners and drag it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Selector tool is generally used to configure a selection inside a
      filter (generally those one which contain the tab <em>Select</em> in the
      GUI).
    </p>
    <h3 id="ruler"><a class="toclink" href="#ruler">Ruler</a></h3>
    <p>
      The Ruler tool is used to define the distance between the objects in an
      image. When selected, if you move the mouse pointer over the
      <em>Viewer</em>, the pointer will become a cross and you will be able to
      select any couple of points on the image. As the segment of interest has
      been selected, the tool panel will show its "Point 1" and "Point 2"
      coordinates, its pixel "Length" and its "Angle" with respect to the
      horizontal axis. If you want to change the selected points afterwards,
      just drag them wherever you want; while, the selected segment will be
      disabled by clicking on a point of the image.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ruler tool is used by some filters (for example,
      <em>Motion Deblurring</em> or <em>Measure 1d/2d/3d</em>) in order to
      automatically configure parameters related to distance and angles.
    </p>
    <h3 id="quadrilateral">
      <a class="toclink" href="#quadrilateral">Quadrilateral</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      When the Quadrilateral tool is selected, the mouse pointer will become a
      cross moving it over the <em>Viewer</em> and you can select the four
      vertices of the polygon that will be drawn on the image. When you mark the
      coordinates, they will appear in the <em>Point 1</em>, <em>Point 2</em>,
      <em>Point 3</em>, <em>Point 4</em> boxes of the tool panel. If you want to
      change the selected points afterwards, just drag them wherever you want;
      while, by clicking outside the selected polygon, it will be disabled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Points is used by some filters (for example
      <em>Perspective Correction</em>) to automatically configure parameters
      related to some selection areas.
    </p>
    <h3 id="point"><a class="toclink" href="#point">Point</a></h3>
    <p>The Point tool allows selecting a single point in the image.</p>
    <p>
      The Point is used by some filters to configure single point coordinates.
    </p>
    <h3 id="histogram"><a class="toclink" href="#histogram">Histogram</a></h3>
    <p>
      The histogram panel shows the histogram of the currently displayed image
      and some details on the statistical distribution of pixel values. The
      image histogram is a graphical representation of the tonal distribution in
      a digital image. The horizontal axis of the graph represents the tonal
      variations (from 0 to 255), while the vertical axis represents the number
      of pixels in that particular tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the <em>Channels</em> option you can choose what channel(s) to plot
      on the histogram:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>RGB</strong>: plots the histogram of all the three channels
        together;
      </li>
      <li><strong>Red</strong>: plots the histogram of the red channel;</li>
      <li><strong>Green</strong>: plots the histogram of the green channel;</li>
      <li><strong>Blue</strong>: plots the histogram of the blue channel;</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Y</strong>: plots the histogram of the intensity value
        (corresponding to the image itself for gray scale images and the gray
        scale converted image for color images).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Under the histogram you will find, for the selected channel(s), the
      following statistics:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Min</strong>: minimum value of the image (0-255);</li>
      <li><strong>Max</strong>: maximum value of the image (0-255);</li>
      <li><strong>Mean</strong>: average value of the image (0-255);</li>
      <li><strong>StdDev</strong>: standard deviation of image values.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      At the top of the panel you can select the box
      <strong>Show Saturated Pixels</strong>. If you check it, all pixels whose
      value is 0 (R = G = B = 0) will be colored in blue and all pixels whose
      value is saturated (R = G = B = 255) will be colored in red. This is very
      useful to verify you are not applying excessive enhancements causing loss
      of information.

    </h4>
    <p>
      The filter is applied only to the selected area of interest, tracking the
      object of interest in all the frames. In order to set the object to track,
      find a frame where you see it better, set a selection around it and click
      <em>Set</em> on the <em>Selection</em> tab. For every frame,
      <em>Static Tracking</em> will try to find the best matches the reference
      selection taken on the reference frame. This type of tracking is best for
      non-animated subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you set only one reference frame, it will be used as reference for the
      tracking in all the other frames. If you set more than one reference
      frame, the tracking will start on the first reference frame and will stop
      with the last reference frame. You can also set intermediate reference
      selections.

      <a class="toclink" href="#dynamic-tracking">Dynamic Tracking</a>
    </h4>
    <p>
      The filter is applied only to the selected region, tracking the selected
      area of interest in all the frames. In order to set the object to track,
      move to a frame where you see it best and set a selection around it. Then
      click <em>Set</em> on the <em>Selection</em> tab.
      <em>Dynamic Tracking</em> will attempt to find the area of the image in
      each frame the best matches the reference selection on the previous frame.
      <em>Dynamic Tracking</em> works differently from
      <em>Static Tracking</em> as the reference selection will be updated after
      each frame. The best results can be obtained if the reference frame is set
      to the first frame of the video where the object of interest appears.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you set only one reference frame, it will be used as reference for the
      tracking in all the other frames. If you set more than one reference
      frame, the tracking will start on the first reference frame and will stop
      with the last reference frame. You can also set intermediate reference
      selections.
    </p>
    <p>
      For significant movement, the more reference frames specified, the better
      the possible result.

    <p>
      <em>Manual Tracking</em> allows the user to select manually different
      selections of different frames. The selections on intermediate frames will
      be calculated interpolating the position and the size of set selections on
      closest frames.

      >
    </h4>
    <p>
      If you want to keep the scene steady around a moving object it is better
      to use either <em>Static Tracking</em> or <em>Dynamic Tracking</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Static Tracking</em> is usually more precise but less robust then
      <em>Dynamic Tracking</em>. It tracks the object very accurately if it's
      not changing too much from frame to frame. For example usually
      <em>Static Tracking</em> is very effective on shaking license plates or
      other inanimate objects. If the appearance of the license plate is
      changing too much, for example because the car is coming closer to the
      camera, then you'll need to use <em>Dynamic Tracking</em>. Also if you
      need to track people or faces, <em>Dynamic Tracking</em> is usually the
      better choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the target to track is not present in all the frames, you first want to
      work only on a part of the video. It is helpful to use a filter from the
      <em>Select Frames</em> group and select the frames where the target is
      present prior to using a filter with <em>Dynamic Tracking</em> selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Manual Tracking</em> is a better option when the scene is static but
      you want to follow some subject moving in it.
    </p>
    <p>For all the tracking modes, with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Set</em>: you will erase all current reference frames and set the
        current as the only one;
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Add</em>: you will add the current frame and selection to the
        reference frames
      </li>
      <li><em>Remove</em>: will delete the current reference frame.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Clicking on the items on the list, will move the position of the video to
      the reference frame and will select the corresponding reference area.
    </p>
    <p>
      The behavior of the various tracking mode changes if there is one or more
      reference selection. If there is only one reference selection, that will
      be used to process the whole video; if there are two or more reference
      selections, the tracking will be properly applied only in frames between
      the first and the last reference selection.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the filters <em>Crop</em> and <em>Local Stabilization</em> it's
      recommended to use only one single reference frame or to keep constant the
      size of the selections if using more than one reference.

      <a class="toclink" href="#history-panel">History Panel</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The History shows all the filters that have been added in the current
      project. Filters are grouped in Chains. The first filter of every chain is
      either a loader (from the &ldquo;Load&rdquo; category) or a mixer (from
      the &ldquo;Link&rdquo; category). Any filter with the exception of the
      first one receives the image generated from the filter it has in input and
      send the result of the processing to the filter (if any) in output.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since revision 18800, it is possible to organize chains in folders. If a
      project that uses folders is opened in an older version of بـستا, only the
      chains will appear one after the other at the same level, and saving the
      project will destroy the folder structure. Folders can be added to an
      empty project by clicking on the &ldquo;New Folder&rdquo; link on the
      History panel. A project containing only empty folders can be saved and
      reopened, but will give an error in previous versions of بـستا. It is not
      yet possible to duplicate folders or to nest them in multiple levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chains and folders can be renamed by double-clicking on the name. To
      confirm the change, press ENTER or click outside; to cancel it, press ESC.
      It is also possible to right-click on the name and select &ldquo;Rename
      Chain&rdquo; / &ldquo;Rename Folder&rdquo; on the drop-down menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chains and folders can be collapsed and expanded by clicking on the
      <img alt="MinusButton" src="../img/FiltersPanel_MinusButton.png" /> and
      <img alt="PlusButton" src="../img/FiltersPanel_PlusButton.png" /> buttons
      on the tree view. Empty folders don't have buttons. The tree is
      automatically expanded to visualize the current filter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Filters, chains and folders can be deleted by selecting them and pressing
      the DELETE key or by right-clicking them and selecting
      &ldquo;Delete&rdquo; from the drop-down menu. For folders, a dialog box
      will appear asking if you want to delete the contents as well or to move
      them outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chain mixers (from the &ldquo;Link&rdquo; category) must be positioned
      after their inputs. Only the filters before the mixer will show as
      available inputs in the Filter Settings panel. Attempting to move a mixer
      before its inputs, or an input after the mixer, will produce an error
      message.

      It is also possible to use the drag and drop function. That means that you
      can drag an item to any position inside the history. A marker will appear

      The default operation (move or copy) depends on the type of action, as
      explained below. Holding down the CTRL key will force a copy, and holding
      down the SHIFT key will force a move. Copying a chain will also clone all
      the filters it contains. The shape of the cursor changes to indicate the
      type of operation:

      </li>
      <li>
        Dragging a non-loader filter onto another filter of the same chain will
        move the filter after the target.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dragging a non-loader filter onto a filter of a different chain will
        copy the filter after the target (hold down SHIFT to move instead).

        Dragging a filter on the Bookmarks panel will create a new bookmark for
        the filter at the current position in the video.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The possible <strong>chain</strong> operations are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Dragging a chain at the top of the panel will move it at the beginning,
        outside any folder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dragging a chain in the empty space after the last chain will copy it at
        the end, outside any folder (hold down SHIFT to move instead).
      </li>
      <li>
        Dragging a chain onto a folder will move it inside that folder, at the
        first position.

      <li>
        <strong>Position</strong>: text box display playing position (current
        frame number) and playing time (hh::mm::ss.msec). If the video is not
        playing, you can move on by inserting the desired position: if you give
        an integer number (ex. 10) you will move to the 10th frame, while if you
        give a decimal number (ex. 10.0) you will move to the nearest frame to
        the 10th second of playing (the format, 00.10.0, can be used too).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Loop</strong>: if active, when the end of the footage is

        the frame rate in use in the filter currently selected (default);
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Seek</strong>: if you leave the slider on the center the video

        left it will play backward. The playback speed it proportional to the
        distance of the cursor form the center. Please note that all frames will
        be played;
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Skip</strong>: similar to <em>Seek</em>, but frames will be
        skipped; it's faster than <em>Seek</em>, but excessively large steps may
        obstacle the vision of some sudden event in the video.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The <em>Position</em> slider, on the bottom of the <em>Player</em> panel
      will let you move on the range of frames of the video. On the left you can
      read start frame and start time and on the right side stop frame and stop
      time.

    </h2>
    <p>
      This is part of the Player Panel which allows previewing of the audio
      track associated with a video.
    </p>
    <p>
      Different colors on the preview correspond to different channels of the
      audio track. For example, red to the left channel and blue to the right
      channel in a stereo (2-channel) audio track.

    <p>
      Usually, the audio sampling frequency is so high that a sample-by-sample
      plot becomes unreadable at lower zoom levels; in those cases, the
      envelope* plot is used instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several ways to zoom into the preview in order to see more audio
      track details.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Right-clicking over the plot activates the context menu. There are
        zooming actions like zoom in, out or reset, both horizontally and
        vertically.
      </li>
      <li>Holding CTRL enables zooming horizontally using the mouse.</li>
      <li>
        <p>Holding SHIFT enables zooming vertically using the mouse.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Left-click or wheel up will zoom in.</li>
          <li>Right-click or wheel down will zoom out.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      * Envelope, the outer shape of a signal plot, presented here is the
      root-mean-square (RMS) envelope, determined using a sliding window over
      multiple samples. It gives a measure of the power of the signal.

      It is possible to scroll the preview with the mouse wheel. Wheel up will
      seek frames forward and wheel down will seek frames backward.

    <p>
      This is part of the Player Panel which allows previewing of annotation

      Annotation Ranges Panel substitutes the Audio Panel when an Annotate
      filter is being configured.

      The preview eases handling multiple annotations. Colored lines indicate
      ranges of frames to which annotations are applied. Every line is related
      to a single annotation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The color of each line is determined by the color the user sets for the
      annotation object. This is a quick and easy way to distinguish different
      annotations straight from the player panel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vertical order with which lines stack over each other reflects the
      current layering of annotations. For example, if you bring to front an
      annotation, its line will move up to the top. That’s a very effective and
      simple way to know which is the current layering of all annotations in
      every frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you click on an annotation object, you will notice two vertical
      segments at both ends of a line. It’s a way to quickly show where the
      currently selected object appears and disappears from the video. This is
      especially useful when you have many annotations, and therefore many lines
      in the preview.
