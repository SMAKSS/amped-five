<p>This document will provide an overview of the basics of our concept and philosophy for FIVE and how to work with it in an efficient manner. Please take 5 minutes to read it carefully, this will jumpstart your productivity with FIVE!</p>
<h2 id="loading-a-file"><a class="toclink" href="#loading-a-file">Loading a file</a></h2>
<p>FIVE is unique in that it allows the user to work exactly in the same way with videos, images, and with a sequence of images (which are folders that contains two or more images of the same size).
The quickest way to load an image or video file is to drag it on FIVE main window.
You can also drag a whole folder.  In that case, all the images contained in the folder will be loaded as sequence. You can accomplish the same doing a multiple selection.</p>
<p>Choose one image of yours or one from FIVE sample folder (that you can enable from the menu <em>Help / Open Samples Folder</em>).
Once you have loaded a file, you'll see an image (the first frame in case of a video, or the first image in a sequence or just the single image from a jpeg) in the center of FIVE window. This is the <em>Viewer</em>. On the right side, you should see three Panels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filter Settings</li>
<li>History</li>
<li>Bookmarks</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's focus on the first two.
In the <em>Filter Settings</em> window, you can see the parameters of the current filter. In the case of a single image you should see only the filename of the loaded file. More complex filters may have even ten and more parameters.</p>
<p>In the <em>History</em> you will see all the filters that have been applied so far. Filters can be stacked together in <em>Chains</em>.
If you loaded a single image file you should see one chain with a single filter, <em>Image Loader</em>, which is loading the image from file.</p>
<h2 id="adding-a-filter"><a class="toclink" href="#adding-a-filter">Adding a filter</a></h2>
<p>Dragging the image file automatically created a filter for us, but in general filters are added with the <em>Filters</em> panel on the left side of FIVE main window.
They are divided in different groups depending on their function.</p>
<p>In FIVE, everything is done with a filter, loading a video, exporting a sequence, applying some denoising, selecting frames, taking measures and so on...  This concept of filtering allows for very fast, predictable workflow.  We do not alter or modify the original file or feed by filtering so we do not disturb original evidence.</p>
<p>Every filter takes as input the image or video generated by the previous filter and, after the processing, pass the result to their output filter (if any).</p>
<p>In this case we can go over the <em>Adjust</em> category and click over <em>Contrast Brightness</em>.</p>
<p>At this point you should see on the right that in the <em>History</em> there is a new filter called <em>Contrast Brightness</em> and that filter <em>Settings</em> shows its current parameters.</p>
<p>If you move the sliders in the panel you will apply the processing settings to the displayed image.</p>
<p>At this point you can add any other filter you want.
All the filters will appear on the history tree.
Try a few and experiment.</p>
<h2 id="modifying-a-filter"><a class="toclink" href="#modifying-a-filter">Modifying a filter</a></h2>
<p>Very often the scientific method you should apply in your forensic analysis will be experimenting with different filters and settings in a trial and error manner to find the right filter group or settings to correct unique problems. With most other forensic image processing software, this is a very long process that often must be restarted if one filter has to be changed or results are not optimal.  FIVE architecture has been built with this in mind. Reviewing and modifying any step of the processing is quick and easy and as simple as replacing, deleting or moving filters anywhere in the chain.  Our one rule is that the first filter must be a loader and it is a good idea to have some filters before others (<em>Deinterlace</em>, as an example).</p>
<p>If you click on any item you can find in the <em>History</em> you will display the related step of the processing. Moving from one filter to another, you will see the progress in the enhancement.</p>
<p>If you want to modify the configuration of any of the filters in any position you will need to double-click on the related item in the <em>History</em>. This will display the parameters for that filter on the <em>Filter Settings</em> panel.</p>
<p>You can even modify a filter and see the real time output effects on another one: in this way you can see how modifying some values on a previous filter will modify the final result. This is very effective especially for complex and long chains.</p>
<p>In order to do this you should: double click on the filter you wish to modify and then single click on the filter you want to view. The image of the second filter will be displayed in the viewer, but keeping the configuration of the parameters on the previous one.</p>
<h2 id="processing-a-video"><a class="toclink" href="#processing-a-video">Processing a video</a></h2>
<p>As said, FIVE allows the user to work exactly in the same way with images and videos.
Let's say we want to apply the same processing steps applied to our image to another video.
It's very easy, just drag a video file from your computer over the <em>Image Loader</em> filter. This will replace the input file (the loader) with the new one.  This method is extremely fast for processing video or images that have similar source problems and allows for very fast output.</p>
<p>Moving over the filters you will see how the previous settings are being applied to the same video.</p>
<p>With the <em>Player</em>, the panel at the bottom of FIVE window, you can move between the frames.</p>
<h2 id="selecting-a-portion-of-a-video"><a class="toclink" href="#selecting-a-portion-of-a-video">Selecting a portion of a video</a></h2>
<p>Let's say your video is very long, but there are only a few frames that are useful for the analysis.
There is an entire group of filters that allows to work on this, they are in the <em>Select Frames</em> category.
If you choose, for example, the <em>Range Selector</em> you can set the first and last frame of interest (and if you need also the step, like one frame every <em>n</em>). You can set the desired frames and then apply the filters.
In order to apply this configuration you must click the <em>Apply</em> button, which is the last one of the <em>Filter Settings</em> toolbar.</p>
<p>While most of the filters, like <em>Contrast Brightness</em> are applied automatically after every change, some other like <em>Range Selector</em> need to be manually applied by the user.</p>
<h2 id="saving-the-project"><a class="toclink" href="#saving-the-project">Saving the project</a></h2>
<p>Let's say that you are satisfied with the results of the processing and you want to save the result. You can save the project with <em>File / Save Project...</em>.
A project does not contain or save any image or video. It is just a list of actions you performed on your original files. This has the following important implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>You should always keep together the original image / video file and the project file</li>
<li>reloading a project always starts from the original image, there is no loss of data or quality due to resaving or recompression</li>
<li>loading and saving a project is very lightweight. You can save many different processing applied to the same file in very little space</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exporting-the-video"><a class="toclink" href="#exporting-the-video">Exporting the video</a></h2>
<p>Having the project is excellent, but we need to export the processed video, in order to give it to someone who does not have access to FIVE.
What we need to do is to add a filter in the <em>Write</em> group, for example <em>Video Writer</em>. From the configuration window you can select the file path and the desired format.  This will create an output video with filters applied.  You can use this filter anywhere in the chain if you want to show a progression of processing from one step to another.  This may be helpful or compelling if presented as evidence in court.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-report-of-the-work-done"><a class="toclink" href="#creating-a-report-of-the-work-done">Creating a report of the work done</a></h2>
<p>At this point we need to create a report which explains the results and technical details of our work. We also use this report to show how our processing has improved some frames of particular relevance.</p>
<p>With the <em>History</em> and <em>Player</em> panel you can respectively move between different steps of the processing and different frames in the video. You can mark the desired position with the button <em>Add Bookmark</em> (the button with the flag you can find on the left of the <em>Player</em>).
One you add a bookmark, it will be added to the <em>Bookmarks</em> panel, which is under the <em>History</em> panel (<em>note: on smaller screens the Bookmarks panel may not be visible, you can temporarily hide or move one of the other panels in the same columns in order to view it</em>).</p>
<p>Bookmarks are very useful because when you click on them you will go to the respective frame and filter. These bookmarks allow quick movement between points of interest.
You can reorder the bookmarks, and set a unique name and/or a description.</p>
<p>The other aspect of the bookmarks is that they will be included in the report. Once you have set a few of them and included a possible description, click on the menu <em>Project / Generate Report</em>. The report of the work done will be ready. The report is saved as a standard html file so you can see it in any browser and with any computer.</p>
<h2 id="where-do-we-go-from-here"><a class="toclink" href="#where-do-we-go-from-here">Where do we go from here?</a></h2>
<p>In this quick walk through we have barely scratched the surface of to work with FIVE, but from here you can start experimenting and trying the tutorials or try to work on your own cases in an efficient way. </p></body></html>
