<p>In this section we describe how to solve some common problems related to the image quality when using Amped FIVE.
Under the name of the tutorial there is a short summary of what the reader will learn.
Please note that you can find all the files in the examples in the folder <em>Samples</em> of the Amped FIVE installation directory or, having Amped FIVE open, by clicking on <em>Help</em> &#8594; <em>Open Samples Projects Folder</em>.</p>

<li><strong><a href="01.html">Deblurring a license plate</a></strong>: in this tutorial we will learn how to open an image file, use the <em>Motion Deblurring</em> filter and generate a report file.</li>
<li><strong><a href="02.html">Enhancing a dark license plate</a></strong>: in this tutorial we will learn how to enhance a dark license plate in a video file using the <em>Exposure</em> filter, stabilizing it using the <em>Local Stabilization</em> filter, reducing the noise with <em>Frame Averaging</em> and modifying a filter while showing the impact it has on the others.</li>
<li><strong><a href="03.html">Enhancing a face</a></strong>: in this tutorial we will learn how to enhance a person behind a window glass deinterlacing the video, selecting the portion of interest, stabilizing the character's face with <em>Local Stabilization</em>, getting a better result with <em>Frame Averaging</em>, enhancing the edges with <em>Unsharp Masking</em></li>
<li><strong><a href="04.html">Measuring the height of a subject</a></strong>: in this tutorial we will learn how to measure the height of a person in a crime scene using <em>Measure 3d</em>.</li>
